# DarkCrypt ‚Äì Privacy‚Äëfirst Message Encryptor

Encrypt and decrypt messages securely without ever sending your data to a server.

## Overview
DarkCrypt is a privacy-first, client-side message encryption and decryption web app. All encryption occurs in-browser using AES-256 with user-defined passphrases. The app is designed with a dark hacker/decryption aesthetic, glitchy animations, and mysterious vibes.

- No plaintext or passphrase leaves your device.
- Shareable ciphertext allows safe communication between users.
- Built as a React + Tailwind web app, deployable on Vercel.

## Features
- Encrypt and decrypt messages entirely client-side.
- User-defined passphrase for each message.
- Copy/share ciphertext safely.
- Stylish dark hacker-themed UI with glitch effects and animations.
- Floating ‚ÄúBuy Me a Coffee / UPI QR‚Äù button for donations.
- Responsive design (mobile & desktop).
- Error handling with subtle glitch animation if passphrase is incorrect.

## Encryption Logic

- Key Derivation: Passphrase ‚Üí PBKDF2 (HMAC-SHA256, salt, 150,000 iterations ‚Üí 256‚Äëbit key).
- Cipher: AES‚ÄëGCM (AES‚Äë256) for encryption/decryption.
- IV: 12‚Äëbyte random value per message.
- Ciphertext Format (JSON):
  
      {
      "v": 1,
      "alg": "AES-GCM-PBKDF2",
      "salt": "<base64>",
      "iv": "<base64>",
      "ct": "<base64 ciphertext + tag>"
      }

- Wrong passphrase ‚Üí gibberish output (no hints).
- All cryptography happens in-browser using Web Crypto API, optionally optimized via Web Worker for KDF operations.

## UI / UX
- Landing Page: Animated, mysterious hacker vibes, scrambled title effect.
- Encrypt Page: Monospace input, passphrase field, encrypt button, read-only ciphertext output.
- Decrypt Page: Paste ciphertext, passphrase input, decrypt button, animated plaintext reveal.
- Typography: JetBrains Mono / Source Code Pro.

## Installation & Deployment

1. Clone the repository:

       git clone https://github.com/ABI2006S/Darkcrypt_.git
       cd Darkcrypt_


2. Install dependencies:

       npm ci


3. Run locally:

       npm run dev


4. Build for production:

       npm run build
       npm start
    
5. Deploy on Vercel:
- Connect your repo to Vercel.
- Use default Next.js build commands (`npm run build`).
- No environment variables required for client-side encryption.

## Usage
- Navigate to `/encrypt` or `/decrypt`.
- Encrypt: Type your secret message + passphrase ‚Üí click Encrypt ‚Üí copy/share ciphertext.
- Decrypt: Paste ciphertext + enter passphrase ‚Üí click Decrypt ‚Üí view original message.
- Support: Click floating coffee button ‚Üí modal opens ‚Üí scan UPI/GPay QR or copy UPI ID.

## Security & Privacy
- All encryption/decryption occurs client-side.
- No plaintext or passphrase is transmitted or stored on any server.
- Clipboard copy: configurable auto-clear after X seconds.
- Strong passphrase recommended; weak passphrases will trigger warnings.
- Optionally, one-time-view mode can clear decrypted text after viewing.

## Donate / Support
Support the project: ‚òï Buy Me a Coffee / UPI QR.

- Floating button at bottom-right opens donation modal.
- Minimum suggested donation: ‚Çπ10.
- QR code clickable / copyable for easy UPI payment.

## Future Enhancements
- Argon2 (WASM) for KDF optimization.
- One-time ephemeral link sharing.
- Encrypted file/message support.
- IndexedDB-based encrypted message history.
- Additional glitchy animations & hacker easter eggs.
